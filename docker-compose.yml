    # [IMPROVEMENT 1: Custom Build vs. Raw Image]
    # OLD: image: mysql:5.7
    # NEW: build: ...
    # WHY: Instead of downloading a generic MySQL image and trying to "inject" 
    # your SQL files via a fragile file-system link, we build a CUSTOM image.
    # We COPY your schema/seed files directly inside the container during the build.
    # This makes the "Stale file handle" error impossible because the files 
    # become part of the container itself.

      # [IMPROVEMENT 2: Simplified Volumes]
      # We KEEP this volume to save your data (rows, users, orders).
      # We REMOVED the link to "./db_schema/SQL" because those files are 
      # now inside the image. This removes the dependency on your host OS
      # file system (which was crashing on your university network/drive).

    # [IMPROVEMENT 3: Auth-Aware Healthcheck]
    # The previous check failed because it didn't have the password.
    # We added "-p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}" so the robot can actually login 
    # to check if the DB is alive.
