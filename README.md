Web app for an University project, course name: "TECNOLOGIE WEB: APPROCCI AVANZATI", the app will be a food delivery / online menus create to show menus items and order

## Start of the development

With the use of AI I have created a small roadmap, I will try to follow and  use online resources as youtube videos, I will use the table to store all the videos and resources.
I have found as well a nice Database design that I can copy and modify, since the design of the database is the most critical part of this project.
I will use MySQL and Php.

* `19 January 2026` Creation of the database:
I wanted to learn how to use the CLI to write some queries:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE food_delivery;
USE food_delivery;
```

After using the CLI I always double check with the GUI. So far it seems to work!
