Web app for an University project, course name: "TECNOLOGIE WEB: APPROCCI AVANZATI", the app will be a food delivery / online menus create to show menus items and order

## Start of the development

With the use of AI I have created a small roadmap, I will try to follow and  use online resources as youtube videos, I will use the table to store all the videos and resources.
I have found as well a nice Database design that I can copy and modify, since the design of the database is the most critical part of this project.
I will use MySQL and Php.

* `19 January 2026` Creation of the database:
I wanted to learn how to use the CLI to write some queries:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE food_delivery;
USE food_delivery;
```

After using the CLI I always double check with the GUI. So far it seems to work!

My laptop that had Xampp installed started giving me troubles, it shutted down and it won't turn on, for this reason I started working on the front-end part from the 42 school.
We do not have the root priviliges on those machine, so I counldn't install Xampp, but we do have php and mysql service installed as well as docker rootless, so I started testing out and exploring the idea to rewrite the infrastructure as microservice based.
